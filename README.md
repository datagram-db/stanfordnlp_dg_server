# stanfordnlp_dg_server

This project provides an HTTP server returning an enriched dependency graph returned by Stanford NLP represented as a property graph. This code was extracted from this project coming from Giacomo Bergami's dissertation: https://bitbucket.org/unibogb/sherlock/src

As this uses an older version of the library, please use also an older version for Maven (3.6.3).
